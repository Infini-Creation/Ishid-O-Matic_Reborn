Ishido is a puzzle board game consisting of a set of 72 stones and a game board of 96 squares.

Every stone has two attributes: a color and a symbol. There are six colors and six symbols in each stone set, thus creating 36 unique stones. Since each stone comes in a pair, there are therefore 72 stones in each stone set.

The primary objective of Ishido is to place all 72 stones onto the board of 96 squares. The challenge arises because stones must be placed adjacent to others that they match, either by color or symbol. When the board begins to fill up, this objective is not so easily accomplished.

A valuable move is the 4-way, in which a stone is placed in the midst of four others, two of which are matched by color, and two which are matched by symbol.

There are 72 tiles, two of each combination of six colors and six shapes.

At the start of the game, there are six tiles on the board representing
each shape and color.  To place an additional tile on the board, you
must match at least one adjacent tile according to the following rules:

  - To match a single tile, you must match either the color or shape.
  - To match two tiles, you must match one shape and one color.
  - To match three tiles, you must match two colors and one shape OR two
    shapes and one color.
  - To match four tiles, you must match two colors and two shapes.

Players receive points by legally placing stones next to other stones in
the light, interior potion of the board (The Within).  The greater the
number of sides legally matched, the greater the number of points earned.
  
Points earned for legal matches are:  
  
      Single-sided match            1 point  
      Two-sided match               2 points  
      Three-sided match             4 points  
      Four-sided match (4-Way)      8 points

Each 4-Way match earns bonus points and doubles the points awarded for  
subsequent matches.  For example, after the first 4-Way, a single-sided
match earns two points, a two-sided match earns four points, a three-sided
match earns eight points, and a 4-Way earns 16 points.  The next 4-Way
doubles the point scheme again, and so on.

Bonuses awarded after each 4-Way match are:  
  
      First 4-Way                   25 points
      Second 4-Way                  50 points
      Third 4-Way                  100 points
      Fourth 4-Way                 200 points
      Fifth 4-Way                  400 points
      Sixth 4-Way                  600 points
      Seventh 4-Way                800 points
      Eighth 4-Way               1,000 points
      Ninth 4-Way                5,000 points
      Tenth 4-Way               10,000 points
      Eleventh 4-Way            25,000 points
      Twelfth 4-Way             50,000 points

At the end of the game, bonuses are awarded when fewer than three stones

     Two stones left in pouch      100 points
     One stone left in pouch       500 points
     Empty pouch                  1000 points

Tournament Mode

In  this mode, you can play the same sequence of stones many times, so that
you can make a tournament with friends, or something like this. Except of
that, it works almost the same like the one-player-mode.

At  the  beginning  you're  asked,  wether you want to continue the current
tournament (CONTINUE) or to start a new one (NEW).  CANCEL gets you back to
the  main menu.

(In this mode, no help is allowed, what is also told you if you try.)  And of
course  there  is  a  special  page  in  the  hall of fame, for the current
tournament.

Ishido est un jeux de plateau consistant en un ensemble de 72 pierres et un plateau de 96 cases.

Chaque pierre a deux atttributs : une couleur et un symbol. Il y a six couleurs et six symboles pour l'ensemble des pierres, et donc 36 pierres uniques. Comme chaque pierre est en double, il y a 72 pierres au total.

L'objectif premier d'Ishido est de placer toutes les 72 pierres sur le plateau de 96 cases. La difficulté s'accroit car les pierres doivent être placées vis à vis des autres en correspondance soit de la couleur soit du symbole de chacune. Quand le plateau commence à se remplirt, ce but n'est pas facile à atteindre.

A valuable move is the 4-way, in which a stone is placed in the midst of four others, two of which are matched by color, and two which are matched by symbol.
